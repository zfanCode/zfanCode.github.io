# Understanding Material

## Notes from UBC professor has high level abstraction

- Not much detail is shown on the notes from one step to another (because they have been working on the field for so many years, they wouldn't realize the abstraction is high)
- Abstraction is hidden, so we need to treat every sentence as an exercise to prove and derive it. 
    - Don't compare the studying experience in Langara in which every step is so in detail, because they are dealing with a different kind of audience and I am currently in 4th year.
