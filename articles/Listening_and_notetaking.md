# Listening and Notetaking

## How to stay focus and listen to lectures

- It is easy to get distracted during listening.
    - e.g. when taking notes, when looking at instructors, even when reading text on the slides
- Be cautious when trying to do the above and notice how my attention changes. 
- Try not to look at anything when listening.
    - Look at your own notes or hands for instance.
- Ask questions with quality. 
    - Think thoroughly before asking a question (help me organize my thoughts; better questions)

## Online refactoring

- Try to refactor the notes on the fly.
