# Reality Check

Self-Expectation (self-image):

- I can gain understanding in a short period of time.
    - Expect myself to fully understand something in simply one pass of the materials.
    - I can solve questions sophisticatedly without doing much practice.
        - Expect myself to do fast computation even if I don't have enough practice.
    - I can understand and follow the lectures fully everytime and come up with good questions. 
    - I can program really fast.
    - I get stuck, but can easily unstuck.
    - Proofs are easy to do.
    - Learning only requires one pass of refactoring.

Reality: (in the past)
    - I read the notes for 4-6 times. 
        - I didn't understand everything by simply one pass of the material. 
        - I gain new understanding and refactor it in each pass (not that I refactor fully by simply one pass)
    - I programmed a lot, so that's why I was fast. 
    - It was not easy to unstuck. And I had the help of many office hours.
    - I tried to practice on many questions (even all questions at the end of the chapter for each chapter).
        - I didn't have enough practice after going to UBC, but expect the same sophisticated skills to solve problems.
